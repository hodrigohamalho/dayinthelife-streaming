As part of the acquisition, your team at International Inc's is now working with Fleur de Lune's IT department to learn more about Event-Driven Architecture or EDA. By applying event-driven concepts you will help to avoid classic problems derived from coupled synchronous service calls and avoid the need to implement additional infrastructure components. 

The first step was to migrate their ecommerce orders website from a legacy SpringBoot stack to the new supersonic subatomic Quarkus-based microservices. However, they have been dealing with a high rate of errors because one of the components is crashing frequently. To overcome this, you will need to create a new event bus using self-service messaging and implement new event-driven services and APIs using a highly productive iPaaS suite. You will then need to wire everything together to showcase to upper management how EDA solves some of the problems that came along pure REST APIs.

*Audience:* Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, API Designers, Data Integrators

Red Hat Integration includes an integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) solution that makes it easy for business users to collaborate with integration experts and application developers. It is a full toolchain and runtime, available right from your browser. You will use this tool to design and implement a new API service and to connect with the Event bus provided by AMQ Online.

*Credentials*

Use the following credentials to login into the web consoles:

* Your *username* is: `{user-username}`
* Your *password* is: `{user-password}`

== Creating the Users API using the Low code Integration Solution Fuse Online

In order to create the Users API, first we need to manage to connect with the Users database.

=== Creating the connection with the Users Database

Open link:{fuse-user-url}[Fuse Online Console, window="_blank"] and log in with the credentials `{user-username}` {user-password}` and accept the permission grant.

image::images/01.png[]
image::images/01-2.png[]

Now that you are on the iPaaS solution Red Hat Fuse, Click on `Connections`

image::images/02.png[]

Click on `Create Connection`

image::images/03.png[]

Then, filter for `database` and select the `Database` connection

image::images/04.png[]

Fill the database configuration with the following values:

[source,properties,subs="attributes+"]
----
url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.fuse-demo:5432/sampledb
user: redhat
password: redhat
----

image::images/05.png[]

Now, click on `Validate` to make sure everything is working as expected. If it is all good, click on `Next`.

Fill `Users Database` for the *Connection Name*. Then, click on `Create`

image::images/06.png[]

Now you should see connection `Users Database` listed in the connections page.

image::images/10.png[]

=== Design and Create the Users API from Scratch

Now the we have the Users database already configured as a valid connection, we will create the connection to interact with this database and export it as a REST API.

On the side menu `Integrations`, select `Create Integration`

image::images/11.png[]

Then select `API Provider` from the connections listed.

image::images/12.png[]

Choose `Create from scratch`

image::images/13.png[]

Give it a name:

image::images/14-1.png[]

Click on `Add a data type`

image::images/14.png[]

Fill the *Name* field with the value `User` and 
Paste the following Json and choose `REST Resource`. Then, click `Save`.

[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Rodrigo Ramalho",
    "phone": "11 95474-8099",
    "age": 30
}
----

Click `Save` again.

image::images/16.png[]

Now, click on `Next`

image::images/17.png[]

=== Creating an API for `Get All Users` (GET)

On the previous step, we managed to create all the API Specification using a NiceUI based on the open source project *Apicurio*. 
Now that we defined which are the contract of our API, let's start the development of each method, that in Fuse Online we call it 
as a *Flow*. 

We are going to implement *just two of them*, the *GET method to retrieve all the users and the *POST to create a new user*.

Create now a flow for the GET Method that list all users:

image::images/19.png[]

Add a step in our flow clicking on `+`:

image::images/20.png[]

Now choose our `Users Database` connection created previously.

image::images/21.png[]

Click on `Invoke SQL to obtain, store, update or delete data`:

image::images/22.png[]

Fill the `SQL Statement` with: `select * from users` and then click `Next`

image::images/23.png[]

Let's add a log step for debug purposes in our flow. Click again on the `+`:

image::images/24.png[]

Then choose `Log`

image::images/25.png[]

In the `Custom Text`, write `Loading users from database` and click `Done`.

image::images/26.png[]

Can you see a warning showing that we have a mapping conflict? 
In order to solve it, let's add a data mapping to our flow. In the last step, click in the yellow icon and then go to `Add a data mapping step`.

image::images/27.png[]

Expand both panel clicking on the arrows, drag and drop the source fields matching with the target fields and then click on `Done`.

image::images/29.png[]

Click now on `Save`.

image::images/30.png[]

image::images/30-1.png[]

=== Creating API for `Create a users` (POST)

From the combobox `Operations`, choose `Create a users`:

image::images/31.png[]

Repeat the same steps you did on the previous step: `Creating an API for Get All Users (GET)`

When adding the Users Database, you need to click on `Invoke SQL to obtain, store, update or delete data` and add `INSERT INTO USERS(NAME,PHONE,AGE) VALUES(:#NAME,:#PHONE,:#AGE);` in the field `SQL statement`.

image::images/32.png[]

Also, during the data mapping you won't need to associate the `id` field because it will be already generate by the postgres database.

image::images/33.png[]

In the end, you should have something like:

image::images/34.png[]

Now, click on `Save` and then on `Publish`

image::images/35.png[]

Now, we need to wait Openshift build our container. When done, you should see `Published version 1` on the top of the page.

If you go to the `Home` page, we have 1 integration running.

image::images/37.png[]

=== Testing your integration

You can check if your integration is working properly running clicking on `View` Integration and Copy and the External URL.

With the URL in hand, try to do a GET on the /users endpoint.

Also, take a look into the logs into the new deployed application, it's a Apache Camel microservice. 
All the work that we have done so far through this righ GUI it's generating Camel routes, if you look in details you can see by the logs 
that the API Specification is available on the `/openapi.json` endpoint.

[type=verification]
Could you see the list of users returned by the /users endpoint?

== Exposing the Users API through Red Hat 3Scale API Management

First, to get familiarized with 3Scale, let's open the Welcome Wizard that is part of 3Scale admin onboarding for users' first access.

We are going to Create a *Backend* > a *Product* > and *Define some Method* and test it. 

This is the most basic flow. That is a lot of things being created automatically for you behind the scenes. We are going to explore it in detail in the next sessions.

image::images/wizard-03.png[]
image::images/wizard-04.png[]
image::images/wizard-05.png[]
image::images/wizard-06.png[]
image::images/wizard-07.png[]

Ok, try to spend some time exploring the product, navigating into the menus, trying to discover by yourself the features before we go ahead.

==== Creating the User API

Click on `NEW API`.

image::images/38.png[]

Select `Import from Openshift`. Then choose `fuse` for the `Namespace` combobox and `i-users-api` for the `Name` field. Click on `Create Service`.

image::images/39.png[]

Now you should see your new api on the 3scale dashboard.

image::images/40.png[]

==== Creating an application plan for our API

We need to create an application plan for our users api. Click on `Dashboard` menu and then on `i-users-api`

image::images/41.png[]

Now, click on `Create Application Plan`.

image::images/42.png[]

For the `Name` field use: `Basic Plan`. And for the `System name`: `basic-plan`. Now click on `Create Application Plan`.

image::images/43.png[]

We need to publish our application plan. To do that, click on `Publish`

image::images/44.png[]

==== Creating an application for our API
